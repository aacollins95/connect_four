#'\xE2\x97\x8B' white

Okay so this is just some thoughts on how to make connect four

ORIGIN = (0,0)
coords will be X,Y NOT row,col
fuck row,col

Might want to make a Column class
  height 6
  add piece



Board would be Seven Columns

5

4

3

2

1

0   1   2   3   4   5   6


Piece class would be good as well
Maybe piece should be a slot class, can have status (0,1,2)
  class variable, lists created slots in a flat array
  knows which pieces/slots are adjacent to itself
  to_s to display whats inside (space, white, emtpy circle)

How will the board update itself when pieces are added?
  Well, it only needs a 2D

BUGS
placing onto a full column wastes a turn
only detects matches if piece placed at end
